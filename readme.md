# 1-up and chord repeat:

The Ecosteno's configuration can be found here: https://github.com/aerickt/qmk/blob/357a7a942a65f604050a3aefab2e14f21d9cbbc4/keyboards/noll/ecosteno/config.h#L50-L51

The Multisteno's configuration is here: https://github.com/aerickt/qmk/blob/357a7a942a65f604050a3aefab2e14f21d9cbbc4/keyboards/noll/multisteno/config.h#L26-L27

By default double tap chord repeat is enabled, but 1-up is commented out; simply uncomment those lines to enable.

Note that the Ecosteno firmware has only been tested to work on the older version with *blue* switches. There is a slight change in firmware between the pink and the blue version. The configuration between the two is here:
https://github.com/aerickt/qmk/blob/47e9e766f7f820d95a6b7faba3ce3e021eb0aa35/keyboards/noll/ecosteno/config.h#L31-L41

Although this firmware hasn't been tested on the Ecosteno with pink switches, it *should*, in theory, work.
